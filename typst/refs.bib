  abstract     = {We study the training process of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) from the Fourier analysis perspective. We demonstrate a very universal Frequency Principle (F-Principle) --- DNNs often fit target functions from low to high frequencies --- on high-dimensional benchmark datasets such as MNIST/CIFAR10 and deep neural networks such as VGG16. This F-Principle of DNNs is opposite to the behavior of most conventional iterative numerical schemes (e.g., Jacobi method), which exhibit faster convergence for higher frequencies for various scientific computing problems. With a simple theory, we illustrate that this F-Principle results from the regularity of the commonly used activation functions. The F-Principle implies an implicit bias that DNNs tend to fit training data by a low-frequency function. This understanding provides an explanation of good generalization of DNNs on most real datasets and bad generalization of DNNs on parity function or randomized dataset.},
